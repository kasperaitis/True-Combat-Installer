\par 
\par WARNING: Third party maps should be removed from servers unless the map scripts are revised.
\par Wait times (wait 3000) in the old scripts (trigger bomb_detonated and trigger bomb_defused) have to be removed
\par since they might cause unexpected behaviour with the new code. 
\par 
\par Game
\par -completely removed enemy name identifier (was 1.5 seconds delay to avoid "name scanning" before)
\par -fixed scoreboard
\par -introduced "damage rating" (DR) = (damage_given - damage_received - team_damage)/100.0f 
\par -scoreboard now shows score, damage rating (DR), armament availability (AA), ping
\par -heavily modified AA system: Each team is now splitted in three groups (best, medium, worst) based on score and DR (if score is the same).
\par The best AA of the best group equals the round number +1, the other groups get modifiers of 0 and -1.
\par -reduced the AA levels in the loadout to 3 (was 4 before). Shotguns are available from the start.
\par -players get no negative score for being team killed
\par -introduced 5 second spawn protection in 1-life. Lamers that attempt to team kill or grenade spam
\par are passified and "ROE violation" message is broadcasted to everyone.
\par -auto voices ("contact", "taking fire") are only send all 20 secs (was 10 secs)

\par -completely reworked ETs trigger/delay system for bullet weapons to Q3TC045 standard. Bullet weapons are now triggered
\par instantaneously (was 50 msec delay) and semi-auto fire can be retriggerd all 100 msec (was 200 msec before)
\par -massively reduced retrigger rate of semi-auto and pump shotguns. Semi-auto operation is now faster the pump operation. 
\par -fixed deployment menu weapon selection, where some guns could not be selected and ghosted guns could be selected.
\par -fixed problem with saved spawnpoints for the frozen warmup (might not be the problem that occurs on servers though)
\par -fixed bug where elimination of terrorists could turn a won game after bomb explosion to a lost game. Wait times in bomb_detonated and bomb_defused
\par trigger events had to be removed from map scripts.
\par 
\par Misc
\par -added announcer voices for round and match end.
\par -fixed mark projection bug where metal exit shaders where missing
