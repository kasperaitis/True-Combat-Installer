INTRODUCTION
============

ET: Legacy is based on the on the GPL'd source code of Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory.

The main goals of the project are fixing bugs, cleaning up the codebase and adding useful features
while remaining compatible with the ET 2.60b version.

The Legacy mod is the default mod shipped with ET: Legacy. It aims to add many useful features and
improvements, while staying close to the original gameplay, as well as being lightweight and fully
extensible through Lua scripts.

ET: Legacy development is a collaborative effort done in an open, transparent and friendly manner.
Anyone is welcome to join our efforts!
